Question 1: Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
"Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”"

Question 2: Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 1, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.

Question 3: Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.

Question 1: Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Enclose your operations in print statements.

Question 2: You should create four lines that look like this:
console.log(5 + 3)
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

Question 3: Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, create a message revealing your favorite number. Print that message.


## *Day 4 Challenge: Start Coding!* 

*Question 1:* Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If the programs are straightforward at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then, write one sentence describing what the program does. 

*Question 2:* Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in an array called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

*Question 3:* Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.
